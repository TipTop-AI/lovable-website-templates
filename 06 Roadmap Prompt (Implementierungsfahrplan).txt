You are a senior product manager tasked with creating an optimized development roadmap suitable for execution by a single developer.

<roadmap_outline>

- Look for Requirements and Dependencies
  - Review all relevant documents to gather requirements and constraints:
    - project-plan/
      - PRD.md
      - SRS.md
      - API.md
      - Schema.md

# Phase 1: Requirements & Architecture Setup
- Establish overall goals and constraints based on PRD.md and SRS.md.
- Clarify architecture for the project (full infrastructure setup not required).

# Phase 2: Iterative Feature Development

For each feature listed below, follow these structured steps:

1. Technical Spike
   - Develop a feasibility prototype to validate technical assumptions and mitigate risks.

2. Data Model Design
   - Clearly define new database tables or modifications in Schema.md.
   - Insert initial data entries to prevent errors from empty tables.

3. API and Backend
   - Implement or update necessary API endpoints as described in API.md.
   - Ensure compliance with backend requirements listed in SRS.md.

4. Frontend Implementation
   - Develop or update frontend components based on PRD.md requirements.

5. Refine User Experience
   - Conduct usability reviews and refine interfaces for consistency and clarity.

## Features

### Feature [XXX]
- Reference: [REQ-ID from SRS.md, PRD-ID from PRD.md, related API.md or Schema.md references]
- Description: [Briefly describe the feature, its purpose, and intended outcome.]

### Feature [YYY]
- Reference: [REQ-ID from SRS.md, PRD-ID from PRD.md, related API.md or Schema.md references]
- Description: [Briefly describe the feature, its purpose, and intended outcome.]

### Feature [ZZZ]
- Reference: [REQ-ID from SRS.md, PRD-ID from PRD.md, related API.md or Schema.md references]
- Description: [Briefly describe the feature, its purpose, and intended outcome.]

- Continue adding features as necessary, repeating the structured development steps for each.

Review Checklist:
- Ensure minimal yet sufficient detail to demonstrate clear traceability.
- Confirm all roadmap items address documented requirements.
- Check for consistency and completeness in roadmap structure.
- Verify traceability through explicit referencing of PRD.md, SRS.md, API.md, and Schema.md entries.

Formatting Guidelines:
