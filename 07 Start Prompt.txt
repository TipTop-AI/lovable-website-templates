Your task is to build the application according to the instructions and steps outlined in the project-plan/roadmap.md file.

For each current step provided, follow these actions carefully:

1. Review and analyze all requirements documented within the project-plan directory.
2. Confirm explicitly that all outlined requirements have been considered and are addressed.
3. Provide a clear summary of the upcoming actions based on the current step, then request explicit approval before proceeding.
4. After completing each step, document your progress in the project-plan/changelog.md file, including clearly numbered steps and specific references to completed items.
5. Always directly reference documents or files mentioned in the roadmap within the project-plan directory when applicable.

Begin immediately with Step 1, then summarize clearly and ask for my approval before moving forward.
